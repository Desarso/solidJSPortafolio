I want to make a cool text animation

So I am gonna make an array of all of the regular ascii characters, or smaller
I then randomize that array, I then loop over that array, but I need to do so for each character simulatineously.
So I need to duplicate or just several different arrays, and I need to modify each letter on each loop. 
Or maybe I can also randomly choose another letter to change.


He is only using, a few symbols, he loops over them for a few times, 
then it seems like he adds, the correct letters, and then once it choose the correct one the loop exists
I want a functiont that can create this animation for any string of text

I also want reveal animations, purely in css, that I can add, to be onload with just a class
